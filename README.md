### MoM loves all of her children.

## Prerequisities
This solution is very basic and you will need some modules to get started.
[The offcial open source modules can be found here](https://github.com/RolfVeinoeSorensen/MoM.Modules)

## Feature list:

 * ASP.NET 5 (Currently RC2)
 * MVC 6
 * Uses Depency Injection to create a modular pattern
 * Provides a starting point to create your own solutions
 * Integrates Angular 2 to create a basic SPA CMS
 * Themes are build on Bootstrap 4 using Sass
 * Gulp and NPM are also favored

## Flawor
This solution is most likely not for everyone.
It favors developers who wants to work with MVC 6, EF7, MS SQL Server and Angular 2.
The design is meant to give the developer less options on how to build their web application.
On the plus side this should me a more unified style in the modules beeing created.
The file structure and reason why the modules are located in a seperate git project is to make it easy for you to create your own modules project on your github and you can chose to have that private if you like.

## Getting Started

### Installing
Needs description...

## Goal
Mother of Modules is meant to be easy for end users to install and maintain.
It will most likely never have the same amount of features like big .NET based CMS systems offers.

### This solution is not ready for production sites
I am currently working on making this solution ready enough to serve my personal website.
It will in time feature the possibility to load modules dynamically like Orchard 2 allready does.
Wiki and tutorials are still to come.
